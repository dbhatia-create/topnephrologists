          <h2>1. Agreement</h2>
          <p>By submitting a listing application to TopMortgageCompanies.com, you agree to these Terms of Service. These terms govern your listing on the TopMortgageCompanies.com directory.</p>

          <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
          <p>You must be a licensed mortgage company, lender, or broker in good standing in the state(s) where you operate. By applying, you represent that this is true and that all information provided is accurate.</p>

          <h2>3. Listing Term and Fees</h2>
          <p>All listings are annual. The pre-launch listing fee covers the balance of 2026 (from the August 2026 launch through December 31, 2026) plus all of 2027. Fees are non-refundable once your listing is confirmed. Featured Listing fees follow the same schedule.</p>

          <h2>4. Featured Listing</h2>
          <p>Featured Listing is limited to one company per city on a first-come, first-served basis. If a Featured Listing slot becomes unavailable after your application, we will contact you to discuss alternative arrangements or a refund of the Featured Listing portion.</p>

          <h2>5. Listing Content</h2>
          <p>You grant TopMortgageCompanies.com a non-exclusive license to use your submitted content, photos, and website assets for your listing. We may edit or format your listing for consistency with the directory&apos;s standards.</p>

          <h2>6. Awards and Recognition Event</h2>
          <p>An active listing makes your company eligible for the complimentary recognition plaque and an invitation to the Annual Awards &amp; Recognition Event. Event attendance is subject to capacity, scheduling, and logistics, and is not guaranteed.</p>

          <h2>7. Conduct</h2>
          <p>You agree not to provide false information, misrepresent your credentials or NMLS status, or engage in any activity that would violate applicable law or regulation.</p>

          <h2>8. Renewal</h2>
          <p>Listings auto-renew annually at the then-current rate unless you cancel at least 30 days before your renewal date. We will send a renewal notice at least 60 days prior.</p>

          <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p>TopMortgageCompanies.com is not responsible for the actions or omissions of any listed company. The directory is provided for informational purposes only.</p>

          <h2>10. Changes to Terms</h2>
          <p>We may update these terms. Material changes will be communicated by email. Continued use of your listing after the effective date constitutes acceptance.</p>
